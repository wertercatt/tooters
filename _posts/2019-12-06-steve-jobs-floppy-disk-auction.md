From the auction listing:

>“Macintosh System Tools Version 6.0 floppy disk, signed in black felt tip, “steve jobs.”
In fine condition, with slight brushing to the ink. A hugely desirable format for Jobs's
seldom-seen autograph--known as a reluctant signer, he often declined to comply with the
requests of collectors. As a piece of Apple's iconic Mac OS software, boasting Jobs's
elegantly stylish lowercase signature, this is a museum-quality piece of computing history.”

Originally it was estimated that this would auction off for around $7,500 but ended up selling for a mind-boggling sum of $84,115. The real question though is whether the data on disk is still usable and if the buyer will ever try to find out.
