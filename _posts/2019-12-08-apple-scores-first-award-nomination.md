Jon Fingas:

>“The Critics Choice nominations were dominated by Netflix, with 61 nominations
for its movies and TV shows -- 14 of them just for The Irishman, which is up
for top awards like Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor. Other streaming
services also fared better, including Amazon Prime Video (14), Hulu (seven) and
CBS All Access (four). It’s more than a little obvious that Apple is a newcomer
with just a handful of shows under its belt.”

The Golden Globe nominations are being announced tomorrow so it will be interesting to see if Apple receives any more nominations. Of any show they have released so far, 'The Morning Show' is definitely the best one on offer.
