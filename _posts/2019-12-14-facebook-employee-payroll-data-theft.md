>“It seems Facebook just couldn’t make it through to the end of the year without another privacy-related incident.
Only this time around, its own employees are affected. A thief broke into a payroll worker’s car and stole hard drives
that reportedly contained unencrypted payroll information for around 29,000 current and former US employees.

I am having trouble even deciding which aspect of this is the worst part. The unbelievable idea that this type of sensitive data is stored on a mobile hard drive, it being stored unencrypted or the fact that it took three days to notice it was missing. 🙄
