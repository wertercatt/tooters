Ricky Gervais:

>"Apple rolled into the TV game with a superb drama about the importance of dignity
and doing the right thing, made by a company that runs sweatshops in China. So,
you say you’re woke, but the companies you work for, unbelievable. Apple, Amazon,
Disney. If ISIS started a streaming service, you’d call your agent, wouldn’t you?
>
>If you do win an award tonight, don’t use it as a platform to make a political speech.
You’re not in a position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about
the real-world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg. So, if you
win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and your god, and fuck off."

Damn. No pandering happening onstage this year.
