Oliver Haslam:

>"Samsung and Apple have a complicated history. But in reality, it mostly boils down to Samsung "borrowing" design language and features from Apple and then using them in its phones and tablets. Things aren't as bad as they once were, but yesterday the company showed a slide about Samsung Pass. And on that slide was Apple's Face ID icon."

You can't even call this "creative inspiration" on Samsung's part. It is literally a copy and paste job of [Apple's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_ID#/media/File:Face_ID.jpg) Face ID icon. What makes it even worse is that the graphic design of the Face ID icon is inspired by the
[Finder](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Finder_icon_macOS_Yosemite.png) icon which has roots going all the way back to [1984](https://kare.com/apple-icons/).
