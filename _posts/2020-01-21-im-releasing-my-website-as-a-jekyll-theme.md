This website’s design is a custom variant of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and I, in the same vain, have decided to make it available for others to use as well. I named it ‘Noir’ because of the `prefers-color-scheme` support which adds built-in light/dark modes for devices and browsers that have added the functionality. The project can be found over on [GitHub](https://github.com/essentialenemy/noir) and I encourage anyone who is interested to report bugs, request features or fork it for themselves. If you plan on downloading the theme I strongly suggest only using the most recent [release](https://github.com/essentialenemy/noir/releases) or Ruby [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/noir-for-jekyll) and not the current commit. I plan on making it available for Ghost and Hugo as well.
