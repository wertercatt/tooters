>"Ah, scissors. They’re important enough that we have an emoji for them. On your device, it appears as ✂️. Unlike the real world tool it represents, the emoji’s job is to convey the idea, especially at small sizes. It doesn’t need to be able to swing or cut things. Nevertheless, let’s judge them on that irrelevant criterion."

This is such a fun little observation. I have never even thought to consider whether or not the two blades of a scissor emoji would close properly and the fact that they don't shows how few people actually have questioned it.
