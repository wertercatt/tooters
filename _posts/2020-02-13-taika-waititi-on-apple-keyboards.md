It's funny to see this topic make an appearance in mainstream culture but not a great look for Apple. They have [introduced](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/11/apple-introduces-16-inch-macbook-pro-the-worlds-best-pro-notebook/) new scissor switch keyboards but the majority of their product line is still stuck on a [multi-year mistake](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18284042/apple-macbook-keyboard-apology-issues-bad-design).
