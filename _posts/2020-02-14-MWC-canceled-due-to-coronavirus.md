>"Mobile World Congress, the wireless industry’s annual showcase, typically attracts 100,000 representatives from technology companies, carriers, and governments to Barcelona, Spain. But not this year. The GSM Association, an industry group that organizes the gathering, said Wednesday it is pulling the plug on this year’s affair, the latest fallout from the coronavirus global health emergency.

>"The GSMA has canceled MWC Barcelona 2020 because the global concern regarding the coronavirus outbreak, travel concerns and other circumstances, make it impossible for the GSMA to hold the event," the organization said."

Expect to see a whole lot more of this happening.
