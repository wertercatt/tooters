This was pretty much a given:

>"We are devastated to share this news with you. “The show must go on” is in our DNA,
and this is the first time in 34 years that the March event will not take place.
We are now working through the ramifications of this unprecedented situation."

This is very unfortunate because for many people SXSW is a huge opportunity to garner
exposure but this is the responsible thing to do. This comes on the heels of Facebook
[canceling F8](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2020/02/27/important-f8-2020-update/)
and Google [canceling I/O](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/google-cancels-its-2020-i-o-developer-conference/)...all
that is left now is for Apple to [cancel WWDC](https://www.fastcompany.com/90473812/the-coronavirus-is-wiping-out-tech-conferences-and-thats-not-all-bad).
