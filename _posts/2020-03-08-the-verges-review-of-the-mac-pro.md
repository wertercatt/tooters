Nilay Patel:

>"Reviewing the new Mac Pro has been an interesting challenge. It’s very much the product that professional Mac
users have been asking Apple to make for years: a modular, high-performance Mac tower. And demand for such a
machine is well and truly pent up: Apple’s last Mac Pro came out in 2013, featuring a daring cylindrical design
that the company was unable to update for years because of thermal issues. After much consternation about the
future of the Mac, Apple admitted it needed to start all over with the Mac Pro in 2017. Two and a half years
later, we’re looking at one of the most precisely and cleverly engineered desktop computers ever made. I have
been dying to review it."

This is the one review I had really been looking forward to reading and it did not disappoint. It was accompanied
by a [great discussion](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21167840/podcast-vergecast-apple-mac-pro-review-ipad-trackpad-samsung-qled)
on The Vergecast this week too.
