Amy S. Rosenberg:

>"Across Tennessee Avenue, out in front of EZ Super Mart store, a 51-year-old homeless man recently out of jail and a teen who says heâ€™s a heroin addict are waiting for their chance at a few bucks -- most likely, they each said separately, by acting as low-level go-betweens for drug dealers..."

Iâ€™ve been waiting to see a real story about this in The Philadelphia Inquirer for a very long time. The store owners on Atlantic and Pacific Avenues are allowing a drug trade to happen openly all day long. There are arrests being made but it has been a very rampant issue for many years now. Winter time in the city has always felt more depressing because of this constant scene happening in the main downtown area.

>The facade reads "LOTS CORN R" on Atlantic; from Tennessee Avenue, the sign is down to "LOTS COR R."

This has since been fixed. I wonder if it was because of this article? ðŸ¤”
