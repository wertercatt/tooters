>"When Apple released the first iOS 13.4 beta in early February, one of the more notable additions was a brand new CarKey API that makes it possible for Apple Watch and iPhone owners to start, lock, and unlock their vehicles directly from their devices.

>Even cooler is that the API will allow device owners to share access with friends and family members via one-time keys. Imagine, for instance, the ability to remotely give a friend of yours the ability to unlock and drive your car with their own iPhone or Apple Watch."

Apple has made it *mostly* possible for me to ditch my wallet by creating Apple Pay[^1]. I'm able to access my home without a physical key because of smart locks powered by [HomeKit](https://www.apple.com/ios/home/). Now they are working to make car keys/fobs extinct. As a nerd I absolutely love the idea of leaving the house with only an iPhone in my pocket or a Watch on my wrist. As if it hasn't already been the case for years now, this takes the [digital hub strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmvmtmqqbeI) introduced in 2001 as being centered around the Mac and turns it on it's head.
