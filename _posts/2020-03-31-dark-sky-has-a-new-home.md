This is great news for the stock Weather app, maybe it will actually be useable now. It is not such great news for the vast number of third party applications on both iOS and Android that depend on the API for accurate weather data. I currently use Carrot Weather which does offer the ability to choose from alternative data sources but this functionality is also behind a subscription paywall. It will be interesting to see how these companies adapt.
