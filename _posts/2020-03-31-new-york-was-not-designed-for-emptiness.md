Corina Knoll:

>"The lights are still on in Times Square. Billboards blink and storefronts shine in neon. If only there were an audience for this spectacle.
>
>But the thoroughfares have been abandoned. The energy that once crackled along the concrete has eased. The throngs of tourists, the briskly striding commuters, the honking drivers have mostly skittered away.
>
>In their place is a wistful awareness that plays across all five boroughs: Look how eerie our brilliant landscape has become. Look how it no longer bustles.
>
>This is not the New York City anyone signed up for."

A perfect piece to describe the times in which we live and incredible photography too.
