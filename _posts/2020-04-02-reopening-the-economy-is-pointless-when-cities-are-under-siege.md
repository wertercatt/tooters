***The Atlantic*** **has updated the title of the article to, ‘Big Cities Won’t Snap Back to Normal’. The original title will remain the permalink for this post.**

Ronald Brownstein:

>”The counties confronting the largest number of cases are primarily large urban centers that account for a disproportionate share of America’s gross domestic product and jobs, according to a new analysis conducted for The Atlantic by the Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Program. As of Tuesday morning, the 50 counties with the most cases accounted for more than one-third of the nation’s economic output and nearly one-third of its jobs, Brookings found.”

I wouldn’t call it pointless so much as I would call it impossible.
