Apple Platform Security:

>"iPad models beginning in 2020 also feature the hardware microphone disconnect. When an MFI compliant case (including those sold by Apple) is attached to the iPad and closed, the microphone is disconnected in hardware, preventing microphone audio data being made available to any software--even with root or kernel privileges in iPadOS or in case the firmware is compromised."

So great to see this security feature making an appearance in more products now. I'm curious to know how the always listening, 'Hey, Siri' functionality[^1] is integrated because that is not available on a Mac with the lid closed.
