Chris Velazco:

>"The idea of a tablet computer had been kicked around for years, fueled in large part by science fiction (Star Trek's PADD immediately springs to mind) and ever-shrinking components. A handful of companies gambled on the concept, too, and Microsoft's late-90s attempt was easily the most ambitious of the bunch. It languished, as did all the others, for similar reasons. They were unwieldy. They were expensive. Their software wasn't well-suited to, you know, tablet things. And then came the iPad, which solved just about all of those problems."

This is a nice trip down memory lane.
