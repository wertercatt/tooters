Washing your hands *correctly* is very important.

>Schaffner told us: "If you are concerned about the outside of food packages being contaminated, I suggest that you wash your hands and or sanitize your hands before you sit down to eat any food that you might’ve taken out of those containers... Washing your hands before you eat is a best practice even when we’re not in a pandemic."
