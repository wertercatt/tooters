Amazon has published listings for both the [11-inch](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Keyboard-11-inch-iPad-Pro/dp/B0863BQJMS) and [12.9-inch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863F794B/) versions of the Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro. The very first thing I rushed to look at? The weight of the accessory. It's the one thing not detailed on Apple's own product page. Compared to the Smart Keyboard Folio which debuted in November of 2018, there is an increase of 6.4 ounces for the 11-inch model and 9.6 ounces for the 12.9-inch model. While most notable on the larger size iPad Pro, that is a fairly big jump in heaviness. You can argue whether or not the iPad Pro stacks up to being a laptop replacement in terms of capability but when it comes to overall weight both product categories are evenly matched as it stands now.
