Having added statistics for the state's hospital census provides a *ton* of more data. The number of current[^1] and discharged patients, the percentage of bed occupancy, the amount of ventilators in use and the total capacity.

***

[^1]: Which is further broken down by the the percentage of those patients who are in either critical care, intensive care or medical surgical.
