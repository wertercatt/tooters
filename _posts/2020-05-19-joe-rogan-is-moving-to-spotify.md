Instagram post from @joerogan:

>"Announcement: the podcast is moving to @spotify!
>
>Starting on September 1 the podcast will be available on Spotify as well as all platforms, and then at the end of the year it will move exclusively to Spotify, including the video version.
>
>It will remain FREE, and it will be the exact same show. It’s just a licensing deal, so Spotify won’t have any creative control over the show. They want me to just continue doing it the way I’m doing it right now.
>
>We will still have clips up on YouTube but full versions of the show will only be on Spotify after the end of the year.
>
>I’m excited to have the support of the largest audio platform in the world and I hope you folks are there when we make the switch!"

I cannot understand why Apple doesn't enter this market and own it.
