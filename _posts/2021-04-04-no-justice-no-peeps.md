Damian Paletta writing for The Seattle Times:

>"When they went on strike in 2016, members in the union for marshmallow makers chanted, "No justice, no Peeps!"
>
>And on Thursday, a federal appeals court said the Peeps workers had a point.
>
>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled that Just Born Quality Confections, the firm in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, that makes the candy known as Peeps, could not unilaterally stop enrolling new employees in a pension without paying a penalty, something it had tried to do since 2015."

This story ran in 2016 and Congress followed up in 2018. You would be excused for not noticing because of the shit show campaign cycle and resulting presidency that was happening.
