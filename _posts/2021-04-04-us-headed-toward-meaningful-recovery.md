David J. Lynch writing for The Washington Post:

>"Fresh evidence of the U.S. outperformance appeared on Friday as the Labor Department reported that the economy had gained 916,000 new jobs in March and that the unemployment rate fell to a post-recession low of 6 percent. The Institute for Supply Managementâ€™s gauge of manufacturing activity released on Thursday hit its highest mark since December 1983.
>
>These signs of U.S. strength came as Europeâ€™s economic rebound stalled amid surging coronavirus case totals. France last week announced its third national lockdown; Germany and Italy have imposed partial restrictions on activities.
>
>Accelerating progress in vaccinating people against the coronavirus, plus more generous government spending, explains the U.S. edge. As of the end of March, the United States had vaccinated more than twice as large a share of its population as had the European Union."

Following the science and actually making an effort on a federal level to quicken the pace seems to be working. I wonder how long it will be before Trump takes credit for it. ðŸ™„
