Zac Hall:

>"Appleâ€™s Weather app has a brand new design on iOS 15 that organizes data points like humidity and UV index into blocks. Itâ€™s really great on the iPhone at presenting a lot of information without being overwhelming.

>For some reason, Appleâ€™s Weather app on iPadOS 15 doesnâ€™t have exactly the same design. Information is still organized into blocks, but a lot of the blocks are weirdly not about weather conditions."

Absolutely hilarious! ðŸ¤£ (and sad at the same time)
