James Clayton for BBC News:

>"Searches for Kyle Rittenhouse resulted in a list of blank pages since shortly after the shooting in August 2020. Facebook said it would "still remove content that celebrates the death of the individuals killed in Kenosha".
>
>...but "we will no longer remove content containing praise or support of Rittenhouse", a spokesperson said.
>
>Mr Rittenhouse, 18, was cleared this month of two counts of homicide and one of attempted homicide."

Oh, so glad to see the reversal, think of all the missed engagement and ad-serving opportunties gone to waste ğŸ™„ğŸ¤¬
