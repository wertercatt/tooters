Over the years I have had the opportunity (mainly through decision making based on sheer idiocy at the time if I‚Äôm honest) to experience and reside in many parts of the United States. California is a state that I first visited in January of 2008, a trip that began in San Francisco after a multi-day bus ride from Wichita, Kansas and concluded six months later when I headed for the East coast. Growing up in a remote, rural area of south central Kansas that is defined by conservatism (read: racism and prejudice) and religious influence, I could not wait to step foot in the liberal Mecca of the country and what I found while there exceeded my highest expectations.

I spent my time traveling up and down the state to see areas like San Jose, Silicon Valley, Redwood City, Ukiah, Willits and much of the Emerald Triangle with the southern-most point I ventured to being San Luis Obispo. That‚Äôs right‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt visit Los Angeles during all that time and for reasons I‚Äôve never been able to figure out. That fact has stuck with me for years now and I wanted to make sure I had the chance to cross the city of angels off my bucket list and see if a lifetime of opinions and ideas about the city I had developed were unfounded or accurate. Two weeks later I am sitting on a train writing this as I depart from Union Station and make my way east for the holiday season with one less bucket list item and many thoughts to sort through in my mind.

### SMOG

All my life I have had this image in my mind of Los Angeles being skyscrapers nestled between mountains with an endless maze of freeways hidden underneath a blanket of smog covering the city. It should come as no surprise that a state constantly experiencing wild fires and a city with millions of cars would have issues with smog. While it‚Äôs true that smog is present it is by no means as bad *visually* as I had expected but at the same time had a much greater impact on my sinuses and breathing than I could have imagined. Shortly after arriving I began sneezing and coughing, my nose unable to decide whether it wanted to be runny or stuffy, and a potentially lethal combination of Benadryl, Claritin and DayQuil had no impact on improving this situation for me. I made a note to myself to read up on research into the topic and the affect it has on the health of residents of LA and will have a follow-up post to cover this in the near future.

### METRO

I have ridden subway systems in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Denver, Atlanta, Portland and Seattle‚Ä¶the Metro network in Los Angeles is by far the most disgusting and depraved I‚Äôve ever seen. Congratulations Philly, you‚Äôve lost your #1 spot. Every one of the cities I mentioned have issues with homeless people sleeping on the train cars or camping out in the stations, begging for money and leaving trash on the seats‚Ä¶but man oh man does that pale in comparison to the outright freak show and black market expo that is the Red Line on Metro.

I wasn‚Äôt even in LA for a long time nor did I ride Metro a lot but I didn‚Äôt need to in order to get an idea of what the commuters in this city deal with every day. Masks are ‚Äúrequired‚Äù while onboard and in stations but few people cared to follow that rule. Smoking cigarettes and joints is common place and even addicts hitting crack and meth pipes was a constant scene. This is something I would see occasionally in New York and Philly but in LA it was every single time I take the train. Loudly playing music without headphones is something you will come across on any subway system but Metro is much worse and it is immediately noticeable. There are so many people doing this that they will have to move from one car to another to find one that doesn‚Äôt have someone playing music aloud so that they can hear their own.

Young children walking from train car to train car selling candy and soda, every drug imaginable being offered for sale and even people selling pepper spray, knives and tasers. One can reasonably argue that these people selling weapons is a good thing, otherwise how else could I defend myself against all of the other people in this town who do have weapons. The Metro system in Los Angeles is the definition of a shit show and it is obvious that the city doesn‚Äôt care to change what is happening. I would imagine that‚Äôs one reason the train is ‚Äúfree‚Äù to ride in that they want you to tap your card and pay $1.75 to take a ride but the turnstiles allow you in whether you tap or not and the only people I saw paying were tourists.

### FOOD

If it seems like this entire piece has been negative that‚Äôs because the overall experience left a bad taste in my mouth in terms of how I feel about the city. One thing that did not disappoint though was the food. My God, the food! The most incredible Mexican, Korean and Indian food I‚Äôve ever had in my life. The tostadas at Joe‚Äôs Taco Truck on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Western Avenue was to die for and cannot be recommended highly enough. On my way to Union Station I stopped at a street vendor to get some sliced mango and pineapple which was covered in chili seasoning and lime juice ü§Øüòç. If there is one thing the city does have going right for itself it‚Äôs the ethnic food.

### IN CONCLUSION

Los Angeles has many of the same problems that you would find in any major metropolitan area but for some reason the way it gets presented makes it seem so much worse. With Skid Row the sheer number of people with no place to live is right in your face, hundreds and hundreds of tents covering blocks of the downtown area where the people depend on volunteers to hand out meals three times a day. Rampant and open drug use with zero regard for social etiquette on the streets, on the subway, the bathrooms of restaurants and the aisles of retail outlets. Racist remarks being delivered for telling a person no when they ask you for money and the whole concept of manners is non-existent.

Sure, there are small pockets where you can find the polar opposite experience such as in Beverly Hills, West Hollywood and the beaches of Santa Monica. But go just a little bit too far south or east and you are quickly transitioned back into the filthy and morally bankrupt reality that is the city of angels.
