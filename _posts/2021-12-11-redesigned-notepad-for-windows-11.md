Dave Grochocki, Principal Program Manager Lead at Microsoft:

>We are very excited to introduce to all of you the redesigned Notepad for Windows 11, which includes a number of changes we think the community will enjoy! First, you will notice a completely updated UI that aligns with the new visual design of Windows 11, including rounded corners, Mica, and more. We know how important Notepad is to so many of your daily workflows, so we designed this modern spin on the classic app to feel fresh, but familiar.

Refreshing Notepad to bring it inline with the [new design style](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/style/mica) of Windows 11 is a natural progression and I'm sure many people are overjoyed to have dark mode support. The most important aspect of this update is the fact that very little changed. The beauty of Notepad is the simplicity and lack of features. Good on Microsoft for not ruining a perfectly usable app with unnecessary bloat.
