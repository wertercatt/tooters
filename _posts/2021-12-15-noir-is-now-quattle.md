I originally released my website's design as a Jekyll theme named Noir in 2019. I was following (most) best practices to secure my devices and my GitHub repo and through those steps taken I ended up locking myself out of my own account. I spent the better part of the past year trying to regain access, but in the end I was unable to do so and finally decided to move on. The Noir project is now Quattle[^1] and I am picking development back up where I left off in the middle of last year. There were many feature requests made by users of Noir which I am actively working on pushing out in the coming months along with some new ideas of my own.

The theme is available on GitHub as [source code](https://github.com/victorwynne/quattle/releases) or via the [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/quattle). The current version number is v1.1.1 and I have a regular release schedule planned moving forward. For the most part my website will reflect the design and functionality of Quattle but there are a few changes I make for myself which I chose not to make the default behavior for the theme so viewing the [theme demo](https://quattle.victorwynne.com/) is the best option.

[^1]: I wanted to avoid any future issues that could arise by keeping the project name identical. Both confusion from duplicate repo naming on GitHub and gem issues so a rename was the correct decision. The original git repo and Ruby gem remain online and accessible for historical sake.
