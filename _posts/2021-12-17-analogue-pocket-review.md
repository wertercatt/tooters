Andrew Webster:

>The Pocket features a 3.5-inch LCD display made of Gorilla Glass, with 1600 × 1440 resolution. That’s 10 times the resolution of the original gray brick Game Boy. In practice, it looks absolutely amazing. Out of the box, the Pocket supports cartridges from the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance (for other supported platforms, see the sidebar on accessories) and it’s hard to overstate just how good these games look rendered at such a high resolution, with such a bright and sharp display. The monochrome look of the original Game Boy is crisp and clear, but it especially shines when you’re playing color games where you can really see the sprites pop.

This device looks insanely cool.
