>H&R Block, the tax-preparation company, has filed a lawsuit against Block, the e-payment company formerly known as Square, for alleged trademark infringement. In a [press release](https://investors.hrblock.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hr-block-files-trademark-infringement-lawsuit-against-block-inc) Thursday, it argued that the rebranding by Jack Dorsey’s fintech giant is a “shortcut to capitalize on the well-known Block moniker” as well as a “clear violation” of the tax company’s trademark rights.

>“Today’s filing,” CEO Jeff Jones explained in the release, “is an important effort to prevent consumer confusion and ensure a competitor cannot leverage the reputation and trust we have built over more than six decades.”

I definitely have to side with H&R Block on this one. They've even ran commercials for years with the slogan, "Block's got your back". Not to mention Cash App adding [tax return filing](https://cash.app/taxes) as a feature. This is pretty clear cut.
