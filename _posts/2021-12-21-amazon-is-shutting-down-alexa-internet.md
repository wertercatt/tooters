Todd Spangler:

>Amazon early next year will pull the plug on Alexa.com — a website ranking and analytics service that’s unrelated to the ecommerce giant’s Alexa voice assistant platform.

>“After more than two decades of helping you find, reach, and convert your digital audience, we will be retiring Alexa.com on May 1, 2022,” a notice on the site reads. “Thank you for making us your go-to resource for content research, competitive analysis, keyword research, and so much more.”

I'm honestly surprised it took this long to sunset it. Overall I would classify their metrics as wildly [inaccurate](https://neilpatel.com/blog/free-analytics-accuracy/).
