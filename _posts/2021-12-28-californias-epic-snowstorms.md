>California’s Department of Water Resources [reported Tuesday](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/snowapp/sweq.action) that snowfall totals were 145% of normal for this date in the Northern Sierra Nevadas, 157% in the Central Sierra Nevadas, and 161% of normal in the Southern Sierra Nevadas. The snow totals for this month [broke a 50-year record in Tahoe](https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2021/12/27/tahoe-breaks-50-year-december-snowfall-record-sierra-winter-storm-ski-resorts-snow-storm-snowpack/9029766002/) by more than 23 inches (58 centimeters): total December snowfall on Monday measured 16 feet and 1.7 inches (4.92 meters), according to the UC Berkeley Central Sierra Snow Lab. Of that snow total, 38.9 inches (98.8 centimeters) [fell in 24 hours](https://twitter.com/UCB_CSSL/status/1475511462588211200). The huge amount of snow in the area means that the Tahoe Basin is currently at 200% of average for snow water equivalent—the measurement of how much water would be produced when all the snow melts—for this time of year.

So happy to see this for a state that receives almost one third of its water supply from the winter snowpacks.
