Tom McKay reporting for Gizmodo:

>Dave Bateman sent an anti-Semitic screed to dozens of prominent figures in the Silicon Slopes, including the governor.
>
>“I write this email knowing that many of you will think I’m crazy after reading it,” Bateman wrote. “I believe there is a sadistic effort underway to euthanize the American people. It’s obvious now. It’s undeniable, yet no one is doing anything. Everyone is discounting their own judgment, and dismissing their intuition.”
>
>“I believe the Jews are behind this,” he continued. “For 300 years the Jews have been trying to infiltrate the Catholic Church and place a Jew covertly at the top. It happened in 2013 with Pope Francis. I believe the pandemic and systematic extermination of billions of people will lead to an effort to consolidate all the countries in the world under a single flag with totalitarian rule. I know, it sounds bonkers. No one is reporting on it, but the Hasidic Jews in the US instituted a law for their people that they are not to be vaccinated for any reason.”

I am awarding my first idiocy tag for this piece of crap.
