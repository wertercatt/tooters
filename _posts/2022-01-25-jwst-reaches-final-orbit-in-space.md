Loren Grush reporting for The Verge:

>After traveling hundreds of thousands of miles through space over the last month, NASAâ€™s revolutionary new James Webb Space Telescope  [performed its last big course correction maneuver](https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/01/24/orbital-insertion-burn-a-success-webb-arrives-at-l2/)  this afternoon, putting itself into its final resting place in space. Now, the observatory will live in perpetuity at a distance of roughly 1 million miles from the Earth, giving the vehicle a front-row view of the  [most ancient stars and galaxies of the Universe](https://www.theverge.com/22789561/nasa-jwst-james-webb-space-telescope-priorities-astronomy-astrophysics-exoplanets).
