William Gallagher:

>Whereas, the original iPad was launched on January 27, 2010 -- actually shipping to people on April 3 that year -- and it has been a constant success since them. Once customers got to use the iPad, they saw how wrong the pundits, fans, and critics were -- plus how right Steve Jobs turned out to be. Again.

I remember the biggest story at launch was the fact that it was rumored to be priced over a thousand dollars. Shock and awe when it was only $499.
