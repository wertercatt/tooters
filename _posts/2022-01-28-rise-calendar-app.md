Romain Dillet:

>Meet [Rise](https://risecalendar.com/), a new startup working on a calendar app that is specifically designed for team work. Rise helps you see what you have planned, check what your team is doing right now and, more importantly, schedule meetings that are as convenient as possible for the whole team.

Emiel Janson, who was a guest on my podcast [Subjective](https://victorwynne.com/subjective) back in 2015, is part of the team developing this app. Incredible design ideas going on here and glad to see more competition in this space.
