Stephen Hackett:

>Apple killed off Dashboard at exactly the wrong time. Just one year after Catalina killed Dashboard, Apple started allowing developers to bring their iOS widgets over to the Mac in macOS Big Sur.

Totally agree with this piece. I always found Dashboard to be useful and with the advancement of the operating system as of late this would only ring more true. Widgets aren't squeezed together with notifications on iOS but on macOS they are and it makes them feel like an afterthought.
