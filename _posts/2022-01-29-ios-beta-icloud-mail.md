>The [iOS 15.4 beta](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/27/apple-seeds-ios-15-4-beta-1/) that was introduced today expands support for the custom email domain feature available for [iCloud](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/)+, adding an option to set up a custom domain with ‌iCloud‌ Mail directly on the [iPhone](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/).

I don't see myself needing this feature necessarily since this service has been set it and forget it for me, but glad to see it there for setup. I added three domains while iOS 15 was still in beta over the summer and experienced zero issues. The killer feature for me is push mail notification support for a custom domain. No need to jump into the Mail app to refresh IMAP when receiving a 2FA code or similar.
