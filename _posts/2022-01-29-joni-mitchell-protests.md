>"I’ve decided to remove all my music from Spotify," The Canadian singer-songwriter writes in a post on her website. "Irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives. I stand in solidarity with Neil Young and the global scientific and medical communities on this issue."

>Mitchell also [includes a link](https://spotifyopenletter.wordpress.com/2022/01/10/an-open-letter-to-spotify/)  to an open letter to Spotify, which was signed by dozens of medical and scientific professionals in mid-January. It urges the platform to establish a misinformation policy to address the "misleading and false claims" propagated by the /Joe Rogan Experience/, such as Rogan’s suggestion that  [healthy young people shouldn’t get vaccinated](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406315/joe-rogan-vaccine-spotify-podcast-covid-19)  against COVID-19.

Spotify basically spent $100 million to step in shit on a regular basis.
