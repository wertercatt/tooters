<p class="lead">M</p>y initial reaction of "ugh" when first learning about the sale of Wordle was shortsighted. Josh Wardle made the game for his partner and shared it with the world for free, but it sure as hell isn't free for him. The server costs related to even a single page JavaScript web application with millions of concurrent users every single day have definitely been adding up. He was offered a large sum of money and took it. I would have done the same thing if I found myself in that position.

The New York Times already operates popular games like The Crossword and Spelling Bee so Wordle will be right at home. Sure, it's too bad that it will eventually be placed behind a paywall, but *The Times* didn't buy it as a charity case. It could have easily ended up in worse hands so we should all be happy that it didn't.

Congratulations Josh! ðŸ¥‚
