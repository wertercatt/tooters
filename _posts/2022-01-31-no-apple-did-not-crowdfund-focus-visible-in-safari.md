Eric Meyer:

>The addition of `:focus-visible` to WebKit was lead by the community, done by Igalia, and contributed to WebKit without any involvement from Apple except in the sense of their reviewing patches and accepting the contributions. Many of us are mad at Apple for a lot of good reasons, but please don’t let the process of venting that anger tar the goals and achievements of Open Prioritization. The future browser-feature priority you save may be your own.

That is Eric’s response to the dust-up over [release 138](https://webkit.org/blog/12176/release-notes-for-safari-technology-preview-138/) of Safari Technology Preview 11 days ago. You should read it in its entirety for a comprehensive breakdown. What a weird turn of events based on a misunderstanding of how open source projects are supposed to work. In less hectic but related news, the WebKit team published a good [write up](https://webkit.org/blog/12179/the-focus-indicated-pseudo-class-focus-visible/) of `:focus-visible` today that’s worth reading too.
