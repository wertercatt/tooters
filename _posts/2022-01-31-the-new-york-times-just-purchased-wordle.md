>The purchase, announced by The Times on Monday, reflects the growing importance of games, like crosswords and Spelling Bee, in the companyâ€™s quest to grow digital subscriptions to 10 million by 2025.

>Wordle was purchased from its creator, Josh Wardle, a software engineer in Brooklyn, for a price "in the low seven figures," The Times said. The company said the game would initially remain free to new and existing players.
