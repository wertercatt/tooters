Elizabeth Spiers:

>I suspect the answer is that they can edit Rogan -- it’s probably built into his contract, because I can’t imagine Spotify lawyers would have allowed otherwise -- but are choosing not to because they’re afraid of losing the portion of his fan base that revels in conspiracy and view him as an authority figure precisely because he legitimizes these things.

Just like with Facebook, engagement and advertising dollars are more important than ridding the platform of misinformation.
