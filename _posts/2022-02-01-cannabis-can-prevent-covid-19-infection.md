>A [new study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007072/)  has identified cannabis compounds as a therapeutic agent to prevent coronavirus infections by blocking the virus from entering human cells. According to the study’s authors, widespread use of these compounds from pot plants and a vaccination regime could help to fight the virus’s spread and the disease it causes in people who get infected.

>"With widespread use of cannabinoids, resistant variants could still arise, but the combination of vaccination and CBDA/CBGA treatment should create a more challenging environment with which SARS-CoV-2 must contend, reducing the likelihood of escape," the study’s authors write.

>As detailed in a new study published in the peer-reviewed [Journal of Natural Products](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007072/) by researchers from Oregon State University and Oregon Health & Sciences University, the scientists were looking for a biological compound that could bind with the spike protein of the SARS-COV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. Using a technique called affinity-selection mass spectrometry (used to quickly assess a large volume of compounds) on cannabis, the researchers honed in on three compounds: cannabigerolic acid, or CBG-A; tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, or THC-A; and cannabidiolic acid, or CBD-A. Sadly, since THC-A is a controlled substance, they couldn’t get enough of the stuff to assess its effects and focused on the others.

Imagine the medical advancements we could see if the federal government would get in line with the [majority of states](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/cannabis-legalization-states-map-831885/amp/) and just legalize it already.
