Maximiliano Firtman:

>App Library is more useful on every new version as the Home Screen is now a place for widgets and for placing different icons based on different Focus settings. PWAs are still hidden from App Library's folders. They appear in App Library's Search, making a UX problem (they exist and do not exist simultaneously, in the same section).
>
>The iOS Simulator renders the PWA icons in a "WebClips" category to make things even weirder. But this category doesn't exist on the actual device, which makes me think someone removed it explicitly from the devices.

How on earth is this still an issue?
