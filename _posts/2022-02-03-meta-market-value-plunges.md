Richard Lawler:

>The price of shares in Meta -- the parent company of Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Meta Quest (fka Oculus) -- dropped more than 25 percent at the start of trading on Thursday, after it  [revealed its first-ever sequential decline in Facebook’s daily active users](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914970/facebook-app-loses-daily-users-first-time-earnings) . By the time the markets closed, the company had seen $230 billion in market value wiped out, the biggest one-day loss ever by a US company.

A well-deserved outcome.
