Chaim Gartenberg:

>Coinbase just made its Super Bowl debut with a remarkable clever QR code ad that might have been too popular: the company’s “Less talk, more Bitcoin,” campaign appears to have [temporarily knocked out its app](https://drops.coinbase.com/?qr) following the ad airing during the broadcast.
>
>The full 60-second ad almost entirely consisted of a colorful bouncing QR code, reminiscent of the iconic [bouncing DVD logo meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bouncing-dvd-logo). When scanned, the code brought viewers to Coinbase’s promotional website, offering a limited time promotion of $15 worth of free Bitcoin to new sign ups, along with a $3 million giveaway that customers can enter.

[Alex Lindsay](https://twitter.com/alexlindsay/status/1493273524424744961?cxt=HHwWgoCp_fqWlrkpAAAA) had  the perfect take:

>The Coinbase Super Bowl ad was a perfect example of Function over Form. It will not win awards for the agency, it was not very pleasing to look at...
>
>It did produce incredible results. The app went from 186 to number 2 on the app store.
>
>We can all learn something from that.
