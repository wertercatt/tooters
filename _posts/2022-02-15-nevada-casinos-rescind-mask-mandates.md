Scott Sonner and Ken Ritter reporting for The Seattle Times:

>Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak announced that the state no longer required face coverings in most places, “effective immediately.”
>
>But to avoid having students rip off their masks in class, he said rules for schools remained in place until the end of the day.
>
>“Masks are not required for students and teachers and employees beginning tomorrow morning,” the governor said.
>
>The Nevada Gaming Control Board quickly followed with an order lifting the face covering rule for casinos “unless a local jurisdiction still imposes such a requirement.”
>
>“I want to be clear, the emergency is not over,” Sisolak said. “The pandemic is not over. We’re still getting far too many cases, far too many hospitalizations and far too many deaths.”
>
>“I’m hopeful and confident, based on the data we have, we are in a good positions to drop this and to give people back some freedom. Everyone wants to get back to their normal life … I mean, its been two years. I think the time has come,” he said.

Stating that the pandemic is not over while removing restrictions statewide. That really says it all.
