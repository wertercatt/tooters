Amanda Silberling:

>Donald Trump’s media group released its [TRUTH Social](https://truthsocial.com/) iOS app today in the U.S., but a scan of the app’s API using publicly available tools revealed that it already closed itself to registrations (also, the scan showed that its “proprietary account registration microservice” is named “Pepe,” which is also the name of a meme with [racist connotations](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-pepe-the-frog-hate-symbol-20161011-snap-htmlstory.html)).

I signed up for an account and the app reported that I am number 49,763 on the waitlist. An hour later I receive an email stating that I am number 129,763. So something is royally screwed up on their backend. Obviously I have no intention of making regular use of a trash community like this, but I was curious to see who starts using it as a platform and what the tone is like.
