I have spent the last week paying close attention to the situation unfolding in Ukraine. It is beyond horrific and depressing. There are so many angles, and different aspects to follow it can be somewhat impossible to keep up. One that sticks out to me (for obvious reason) is Apple's response to the invasion.

Apple's statement to the media:

>"We are deeply concerned about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and stand with all of the people who are
>suffering as a result of the violence. We are supporting humanitarian efforts, providing aid for the unfolding
>refugee crisis, and doing all we can to support our teams in the region.
>
>We have taken a number of actions in response to the invasion. We have paused all product sales in
>Russia. Last week, we stopped all exports into our sales channel in the country. Apple Pay and other
>services have been limited. RT News and Sputnik News are no longer available for download from the App
>Store outside Russia. And we have disabled both traffic and live incidents in Apple Maps in Ukraine as a
>safety and precautionary measure for Ukrainian citizens.
>
>We will continue to evaluate the situation and are in communication with relevant governments on the
>actions we are taking. We join all those around the world who are calling for peace."

I'm glad that Tim Cook, and the company as a whole made the morally correct decision here. They will land on the right side of things.

Glory to Ukraine! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦
