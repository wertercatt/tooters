>It’s official — Apple’s doing a product launch event on Tuesday, March 8. The company sent out invitations bearing the phrase “Peek performance,” a Dad-Joke-level play on words that frustrated [humorless editors](https://twitter.com/EllenYChang/status/1499081401609723907) and [sticklers](https://twitter.com/NewsyNick/status/1499105700504612865) everywhere.

>Now begins the reading of the tea leaves. While I usually try not to give myself a [pareidolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia) headache by staring at Apple artwork and asking “what does it all *mean*, maaaaan?”, in this case I think it’s worth mulling things over a little bit.

>It’s all about that second word—*performance*. Ever since Apple started including its own chip designs in Macs, Apple has—[rightfully](https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/11/m1-macs-review/)—promoted the power and promise of those chips heavily. Since new iPhone-class processors only really appear in the fall, this has to be a reference to Macs running Apple silicon.

The event title does indicate the Mac seeing some love, and I would expect the larger iMac to get a redesign. I also expect a "peek" at the rumored AR/VR product because the logo on the [events page](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/) is itself an augmented reality experience.
