>Previously, Apple's apps tried to sidestep the issue by refusing to record Crimea as part of any country when accessed in most places. However, in 2019 [Apple updated its Maps and Weather apps to show Crimea as part of Russia](https://mashable.com/article/apple-maps-crimea-russia-ukraine) when viewed within Russia, defying international consensus and angering Ukrainians.
