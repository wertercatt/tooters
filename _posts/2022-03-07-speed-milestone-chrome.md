>We go deep on every platform where Chrome runs to provide the fastest possible experience. We’re excited to announce that in M99, Chrome on Mac has achieved the highest score to date of any browser – 300 – in Apple’s [Speedometer](https://browserbench.org/Speedometer2.0/) browser responsiveness benchmark.

>Building on many performance changes over the last year, we enabled [ThinLTO](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/12/faster-chrome-let-the-compiler-do-the-work/) in M99, a build optimization technique that inlines speed-critical parts of the code base, even when they span multiple files or libraries. The result? An additional across-the-board speed bump that makes Chrome 7% faster than current builds of Safari. Combined with recent graphics optimizations (namely, pass-through decoder and out-of-process rasterization), our tests have also shown Chrome’s graphics performance to be 15% faster than Safari. Overall, since launching Chrome on M1-based Macs in late 2020, Chrome is now 43% faster than it was just 17 months ago!

Noticeably absent from this blog post; any mention of the amount of RAM gobbled up or the major hit to battery life in comparison to Safari. Wonder why?
