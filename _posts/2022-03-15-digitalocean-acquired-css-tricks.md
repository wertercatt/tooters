>When I started CSS-Tricks in 2007, I couldn’t have imagined how much it would grow. I *wanted* it to grow, that was the plan, but now it’s a far bigger job than any one person can do. That, I was never ready for.

>Let me take a quick moment to give some thanks here. I had the incredible help of [Geoff](https://geoffgraham.me/)as lead editor, sponsor wrangler, and site manager. [Robin](https://www.robinrendle.com/) turned the [newsletter](https://css-tricks.com/newsletters/) into the must-read industry rag it is now. It’s a family business as well! My wife Miranda helped with the books, working with authors, and her guidance on running the site as a proper publication has led the site where it is. I literally couldn’t have done it without any one of them. And of course, the[ incredible group of authors](https://css-tricks.com/authors/), with a special shout out to [Sarah](https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/), a long-time staff writer and friend.

>A small but mighty team, indeed. And that’s the thing. CSS-Tricks deserves more human muscle behind it than I’ve been able to provide for it. That’s where DigitalOcean comes in. That’s the “why now.” They have the resources to put behind CSS-Tricks, and the motivation to do so. I fully trust them to do it, as they’ve been successfully doing it themselves for a long time.

I have been utilizing CSS-Tricks for almost *fifteen years* now, hard to believe. Couldn't be happier for Chris, and the whole team over there. They built one hell of a resource, and I think it will be in good hands.
