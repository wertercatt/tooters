>**SystemSix** is a desk calendar that displays the weather forecast and phase of the moon on an e-ink display. This is a kind of love-letter to my first Macintosh.
>
>It's powered by a [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/). The display is [5.83" e-ink display](https://www.engineersneedart.com/systemsix/SystemSix) from [Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/).
>
> - If you configure it to point to a public calendar it will fetch the next six calendar events and display them (see below, the events are the folder names in the window in "list view").
>
> - Configure your latitude and longitude in the settings and it will fetch the local weather forecast (see below, being displayed in the Scrapbook).
>
> - In the evening SystemSix displays the current phase of the moon (see below, looking like a "desk accessory" in vintage-Mac parlance).
>
> - The trash icon is displayed "full" on the day of your choice (for me it's Monday, to remind me to take the trash to the curb for Tuesday pickup).

I definitely feel quite a bit of nostalgia from this project.
