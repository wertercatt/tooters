Rasmus Larsen:

>The latest app update has removed the option to rent and purchase movies on Android TV and Google TV devices. The two buttons have been replaced by a new 'How to Watch' button which states: "You can buy, rent or subscribe in the Apple TV app on iPhone, iPad, and other streaming devices."

Apple added a button to refer users to an external source to purchase the content. Seriously? Sure, Google allows this, but it sure as hell isn't a good look considering the stance Apple has taken in not allowing the same on their own platform. Definitely a stupid, unforced error on their part.
