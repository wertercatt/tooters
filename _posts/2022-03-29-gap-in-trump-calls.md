>We learned last month that the [Jan. 6](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/jan-6/) committee [found gaps](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/jan-6-committee-white-house-call-log-gaps-1298095/) in the [White House](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/white-house/) call logs on the day of the Capitol riot, as well as that those gaps include times the committee knows former President Trump was on the phone. We learned on Tuesday that those “gaps” were more like one huge gap that spans … just about the entire day.

>*The Washington Post* and CBS News have [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/29/trump-white-house-logs/) that the logs turned over to the committee show a gap in Trump’s phone logs that spans seven hours and thirty-seven minutes, a period of time that includes that attack on the Capitol. The Jan. 6 committee has been intensely interested in Trump’s communications as the attack was unfolding, and is now investigating a “possibly coverup,” according to a member who spoke to the *Post*.

>The dark period begins at 11:17 a.m. and ends at 6:54 p.m. Trump was very much on the phone during this period, during which a mob including his supporters violently stormed the Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of the 2020 election results, but the White House made no record of these calls — or it did and they’re missing. The records do show Trump making calls before 11:17 in the morning — including to Rudy Giuliani and Steve Bannon — and after 6:54 in the evening, including another call to Bannon.

Trump's attitude in public was deplorable enough, but it seems the truly heinous behavior happened in the shadows.
