>Despite the app being limited for use by those aged 13 or older, the report found that a growing number of children are regularly using TikTok â€“ including almost one third of children aged five to seven-years-old.
>
>For kids aged between eight and 11, TikTok was the most popular [social media](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/social-media) platform with one in every three people in the age group having an account, closely followed by YouTube at 27 per cent.
