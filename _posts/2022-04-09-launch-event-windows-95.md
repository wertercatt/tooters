>I want to thank whatever stars aligned that surfaced this video of the Windows 95 launch event in my algorithm. While clips from the presentation have floated around online for decades, the full 90-minute keynote has been harder to track down. Uploaded this week by the angels over at the [Blue OS Museum YouTube account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JzfROUDsK0&ab_channel=BlueOSMuseum), the complete presentation is an absolute time capsule of technology culture as it existed on Aug. 24, 1995. It also features some incredibly cringe moments, most of which stem from Jay Lenoâ€™s cheesy and problematic joke-telling.

Quite the snapshot of a moment in time.
