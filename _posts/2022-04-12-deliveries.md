Mike Piontek:

>Deliveries began as a hobby—it was first released as a Dashboard widget named “Apple Order Status” on January 22, 2006. Over time more services were added, and the name and icon evolved along with it. Eventually it became an iOS app named “Delivery Status touch” on September 19, 2008, shortly after Apple first launched the App Store. When I first created the widget I never imagined I’d still be working on it daily sixteen years later.

>Many things have changed over the years, and unfortunately we’re no longer able to maintain the same service that so many of you have come to rely on. Deliveries relies on many different shipping companies, and without their help it’s not possible for the app to continue working the way you expect.

>It’s likely that over time, more services in Deliveries will no longer show tracking information directly in the app. You won’t see the delivery date, the map route, or any of the details, and you won’t get notifications about changes to the status. You will need to use the “View Online” button to see your tracking information on the shipping company’s web site.

>We understand this will make Deliveries less useful for many of you, and you may decide to take a different approach to tracking your packages. For those of you that choose to continue using Deliveries, we’ll do our best to keep making it as useful as we’re able to. Thank you for all of your support over the years.

My first time using Deliveries was as a Dashboard widget on Mac OS X Tiger. This is definitely sad to see, and delivery companies closing off their APIs is entirely to blame.
