Thomas Ricker:

>Tesla CEO Elon Musk is making his “best and final” [offer to buy 100 percent of Twitter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922045641/tm2212748d1_sc13da.htm) in an updated 13D filed Thursday with the SEC. He’s offering $54.20 per share in cash.
>
>Naturally, Musk had to [sneak a “420” into the offer](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/7/17661178/tesla-elon-musk-private-420-share-considering).
>
>Musk’s wealth hovers around $260 billion, [according to *Bloomberg*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-14/elon-musk-launches-43-billion-hostile-takeover-of-twitter). Twitter’s market valuation is about $37 billion. Musk’s offer values Twitter at about $43 billion, according to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/14/elon-musk-offers-to-buy-twitter-for-54point20-a-share-saying-it-needs-to-be-transformed-as-private-company.html).
>
>Musk is offering to “acquire all of the outstanding Common Stock of the Issuer not owned by the Reporting Person for all cash consideration valuing the Common Stock at $54.20 per share.” The proposal was delivered in a letter to Twitter on April 13th. Musk says Twitter must go private to undergo changes that need to be made.
>
>“I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,” said Musk in a letter sent to Twitter chairman Bret Taylor. “Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it.”
>
>“I would need to reconsider my position as shareholder,” says Musk if his offer is not accepted.

As I said [before](/elon-musk-not-joining-twitter-board/), a lot more entertaining.
