Casey Newton, in response to [this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/04/27/musk-twitter-attacks/) Washington Post piece:

>It’s no surprise that Musk disagrees with current company executives about their policymaking; he has said so from the start. Nor is it a shock that he would use his outsized platform to insult other people; it has been one his primary use cases for Twitter for years now.
>
>But I still find myself taken aback that Musk would single out individual policy executives for this kind of public criticism *now*. In three to six months, if and when the deal closes, Musk is free to clean house; it has been apparent for weeks that few if any of Twitter’s current C-team will survive the transition. But to single out those executives today, while also responding sympathetically [to right-wing conspiracy theorists](https://twitter.com/justinbaragona/status/1519160001805393920?s=21&t=vWfK-g3CvtNdyxD2Qikc5w), creates needless new turmoil at the company during an already turbulent time.
>
>Let us count the ways. Gadde is now facing a torrent of racist abuse and death threats. Leslie Berland, the company’s chief marketing officer, came in for similar attacks this week after a recording of her reading employees’ questions aloud leaked.
>
>And it’s not just executives: roughly a dozen Twitter employees have been doxxed by trolls in the past few days, I’m told. Sometimes it’s because they were responding to one of Musk’s tweets; other times it has been as simple as employees tweeting that they’re looking for new jobs.
>
>At best, all of this has been a distraction for the work Twitter was doing before they were derailed by the acquisition. At worst, it’s leaving some employees fearful for their lives.
>
>And about that issue — the actual consequences for people — the very vocal Musk has had nothing to say.

There is absolutely nothing surprising about any of this.
