Jake Offenhartz:

>Starting on May 4th, New Jersey will join New York and several other states in banning its retail stores, supermarkets, and food service businesses from handing out plastic carryout bags or polystyrene foam products.
>
>In addition to the wider ban on plastic, New Jersey will also become the first state in the nation to prevent grocery stores from distributing paper bags. Shoppers will instead be encouraged to bring their own bags or purchase a reusable one at check-out â€“ or else find themselves carrying out their groceries by hand.

A step in the right direction, but Gov. Murphy is also [taking some steps back](https://patch.com/new-jersey/woodbridge/3-natural-gas-power-plants-coming-nj).
