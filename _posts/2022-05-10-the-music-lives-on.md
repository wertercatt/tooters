>iPod touch will be available while supplies last.

>Since its introduction over 20 years ago, [iPod](https://www.apple.com/ipod-touch/) has captivated users all over the world who love the ability to take their music with them on the go. Today, the experience of taking one’s music library out into the world has been integrated across Apple’s product line — from iPhone and Apple Watch to iPad and Mac — along with access to more than 90 million songs and over 30,000 playlists available via Apple Music.

>“Music has always been part of our core at Apple, and bringing it to hundreds of millions of users in the way iPod did impacted more than just the music industry — it also redefined how music is discovered, listened to, and shared,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “Today, the spirit of iPod lives on. We’ve integrated an incredible music experience across all of our products, from the iPhone to the Apple Watch to HomePod mini, and across Mac, iPad, and Apple TV. And Apple Music delivers industry-leading sound quality with support for spatial audio — there’s no better way to enjoy, discover, and experience music.”

It had a life of 20 years, and has finally been put to bed a little more than 10 years since the passing of Steve Jobs. With the advancement of technology it ended up being a product line that could be transformed into an app, and with streaming music it truly thrives in that form. Although the writing was definitely on the wall for iPod it will always be a device that I admire.
