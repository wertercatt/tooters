Steve Jobs in 2010:

>I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.
>
>I do not make any of my own clothing.
>
>I speak a language I did not invent or refine.
>
>I did not discover the mathematics I use.
>
>I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.
>
>I am moved by music I did not create myself.
>
>When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive.
>
>I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.
>
>I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.
>
>Sent from my iPad

Such an incredible archive and I cannot wait for further releases.
