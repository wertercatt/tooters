Steven Levy:

>For more than a year I’ve been interviewing Apple employees, past and present, about their recollections of Infinite Loop. In their own words, edited for clarity and concision, here is the story of a plot of land in Cupertino, California, that brought us the Mac revival, the iPod, iTunes, the  [iPhone](https://www.wired.com/2017/01/apple-iphone-10th-anniversary/), and the Steve Jobs [legacy](https://www.wired.com/2015/03/the-war-over-who-steve-jobs-was/).

I originally read this piece in 2018, and it’s definitely worth reading again.
