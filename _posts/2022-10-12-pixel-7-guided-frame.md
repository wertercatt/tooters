Steven Aquino:

>The Pixel’s grip matters a lot in practice when using the camera, for example. The relatively poor lack of grip can make it difficult for anyone, disabled or not, to steady the camera when taking a photo. A marquee feature of the Pixel 7 series is what Google calls Guided Frame. The feature, an interplay of hardware and software, works with Android’s TalkBack screen reader to help guide a Blind or low vision person to get into the best positioning for a good selfie. Guided Frame also smartly leverages haptic feedback to assist in confirmation that you did the right thing. For many disabled people, the double dose of sensory input—clinically known as bimodal support, referring to two forms of sensory experience—is not only technologically adroit. Haptics is one way to make use of a device’s panoply of sensors, but the practical application these little buzzes have for people who can’t rely on pure visual feedback is not superfluous. It’s actually extremely useful.

So well implemented. The ball is in your court now Apple.
