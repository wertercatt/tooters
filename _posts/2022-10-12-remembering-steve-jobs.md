Jean-Louis Gassée:

>I still have a vivid recollection of the Oct 4th iPhone 4S announcement: Held in the [Infinite Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Campus) event room. Steve Jobs’ front row reserved seat was empty. On the  [announcement video](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjH5af-8dH6AhWfLkQIHWKNBYsQwqsBegQIBxAB&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSJqPul24DI&usg=AOvVaw0CdiqeejWsMCiwhlSs-Aqz), you can see how subdued the usually exuberant Phil Schiller was; he and other Apple people must have known Steve was on his deathbed while the show had to go on. A day later, we got the news: Steve was no more, taken far too soon by pancreatic cancer.
