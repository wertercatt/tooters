Deante Washington and Christian Richey:

>New York City is limiting the window for residents to take out their trash to the nighttime in an attempt to cut back on the piles of garbage bags flooding its sidewalks and attracting rodents.
>
>The city will change the time households and businesses are allowed to take out the trash to the street for collection to 8 pm from 4 pm, Mayor Eric Adams said at a press conference on Monday along with New York City Department of Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch. Residents will be allowed to take out their garbage by 6 pm if they can place the bags in sealed containers, they said. The new rules will be implemented April 1.
>
>“This will reduce the amount of time trash is out before collections,” Adams said. “No more watching these bags litter our sidewalks.”

This will have literally zero impact on the issue. Talk about taxpayer waste.
