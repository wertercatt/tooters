>[Taylor Swift](https://www.billboard.com/artist/taylor-swift) achieves her 11th No. 1 album on the  [Billboard 200](https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/) chart (dated Nov. 5) as Midnights arrives with the biggest week for any album in nearly seven years. The set launches with 1.578 million equivalent album units earned in the U.S. in the week ending Oct. 27, according to Luminate. The last album to tally a larger week was the debut frame of  [Adele](https://www.billboard.com/artist/adele)’s 25, when it bowed with 3.482 million units (Dec. 12, 2015-dated chart).

It’s certainly *different* than her past work, and also so damn good.
