Mitchell Clark and Jay Peters:

>Elon Musk has announced that a new version of Twitter Blue will include some sort of verification accessible for $8 per month in the US, with the price “adjusted by country proportionate to purchasing power parity.” He announced the shake-up of the premium service [by saying](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587498907336118274) that “Twitter’s current lords & peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark is bullshit.”
>
>Musk also says that the service [will get you](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587500060853424129):
>
> - Priority in replies, mentions, and search, which Musk argues is “essential to defeat spam/scam”
>
> - Ability to post long video and audio
>
> - Half as many ads
>
> - And “[paywall bypass for publishers willing to work with us](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587500624098246656)”

How about including better image quality for posts? The compression on images is so God awful.
