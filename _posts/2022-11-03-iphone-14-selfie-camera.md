>While the large cameras protruding ever-further from the rear of our iPhones capture our attention first — and will certainly get the most attention in this review, as well — the front-facing camera in the iPhone 14 Pro saw one of the biggest upgrades in recent memory, with its sensor, lens and software processing seeing a significant overhaul.

One of those appreciated improvements that remind me of major ‘S’ year features of iPhone in years past. I also find Face ID to be much quicker and more reliable in my use with this years iPhone.
