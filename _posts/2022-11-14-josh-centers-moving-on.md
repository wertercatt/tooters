Josh Centers, in his announcement about leaving his role at TidBITS to make a new home at TextExpander:

>When Apple first announced its own built-in text expansion feature, I thought, “Oh no, Smile is in trouble. TextExpander is about to be Sherlocked.” But that didn’t happen. Instead, the company continued to grow and was confident enough to pivot to an exclusive focus on TextExpander, [recently accepting $41.4 million in funding through Summit Partners](https://www.summitpartners.com/news/textexpander-raises-41m-to-accelerate-automation-and-boost-team-productivity-in-the-enterprise). Most every other tech company is slowing down and freezing hiring—[even Apple](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/03/apple-hiring-freeze-cost-cutting/). The fact that TextExpander is growing and hiring in uncertain economic conditions is a testament to the strong business that Philip Goward and Greg Scown have built from what seemed like a simple utility.

>After seeing that TextExpander had raised that funding, I started keeping an eye on their job openings because it looked like they were about to grow in a big way. I saw an opening for a Business Journalist position, and on a whim—and with Adam’s blessing—I reached out to TextExpander to ask about it. Within a week, I had an interview, completed a test project, conducted a final interview, and had an offer. My mind is still reeling from how quickly it happened.

I’m sure Josh will end up being a true asset for TextExpander, and I wish him the best over there. I really enjoyed our conversation on [Subjective in 2015](/subjective) so give it a listen if you haven’t already. Cheers Josh! 🍻
