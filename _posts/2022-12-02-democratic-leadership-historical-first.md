Mini Racker:

>House Democrats voted on their new leaders on Wednesday. The ascendancy of Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, and Pete Aguilar of California to House Democratic leader, whip, and caucus chair respectively will revamp the face of a body that has historically been controlled by old white men. And it will mark the first time ever for either party in either chamber of Congress to have no white men in any of the top leadership positions.

Awesome progress to see. Meanwhile on the [GOP side of the fence](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/12/kanye-west-alex-jones-donald-trump-hitler/).
