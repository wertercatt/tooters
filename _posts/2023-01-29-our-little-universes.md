Nishiki Liu:

>Spending time back in my second home town as a slightly jaded adult, I noticed that things seem so much less magical. This is probably because I understand much more now compared to when I was a kid, but it got me thinking about how everyone has this process of their universes expanding over time and that changes their lives forever.

I love this shared experience.
