Kareem Abdul-Jabbar:

>Whenever a sports record is broken—including mine—it’s a time for celebration. It means someone has pushed the boundaries of what we thought was possible to a whole new level. And when one person climbs higher than the last person, we all feel like we are capable of being more.

A very well written piece that is certainly a must read. Even for someone who isn’t a fan of sports.
