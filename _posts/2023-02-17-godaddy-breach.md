>GoDaddy said on Friday that its network suffered a multi-year security compromise that allowed unknown attackers to steal company source code, customer and employee login credentials, and install malware that redirected customer websites to malicious sites.

In a [filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1609711/000160971123000031/gddy-20221231.htm) Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said that three serious security events starting in 2020 and lasting through 2022 were carried out by the same intruder.
