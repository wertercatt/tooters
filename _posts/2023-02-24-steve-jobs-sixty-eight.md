To commemorate I rewatched the bit of the iPhone introduction keynote where he demoed Google Maps, and called a Starbucks to order [4,000 lattes](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/the-day-steve-jobs-prank-called-a-starbucks-ordered-4000-lattes-power-of-humor-storytelling.html). Oh, to be the person who answered the phone that day. Wonder why weâ€™ve never heard from them. Surely someone must have tried to track them down in all these years gone by.
