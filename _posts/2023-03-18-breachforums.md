>The FBI has arrested the person allegedly in charge of the BreachForums online hacking community, as reported earlier by [Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/03/feds-charge-ny-man-as-breachforums-boss-pompompurin/) and [Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/alleged-breachforums-owner-pompompurin-arrested-on-cybercrime-charges/). Conor Brian Fitzpatrick, also known online as “Pompompurin,” was arrested at his New York home on Wednesday and charged with conspiracy to commit access device fraud, according to [a pair](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23713838-pompompurin-court-filing) of [court filings](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23713839-pompompurin-criminal-complaint?responsive=1&title=1).

>In a sworn statement, the FBI agent involved in the case claims Fitzpatrick admitted to owning BreachForums at the time of his arrest and identified himself as Pompompurin. [Pompompurin created BreachForums](https://flashpoint.io/blog/breach-forums-raid-forums-successor/) after the [FBI seized RaidForums](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/raidforums-hacking-forum-seized-by-police-owner-arrested/), a similar hacking site that also sold leaked information.
