>We’ve released the code powering our recommendations that you can view [here](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm) (and [here](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm-ml)) to understand our algorithm in greater detail, and we are also working on several features to provide you greater transparency within our app. Some of the new developments we have planned include:
>
>- A better Twitter analytics platform for creators with more information on reach and engagement
>- Greater transparency into any safety labels applied to your Tweets or accounts
>- Greater visibility into why Tweets appear on your timeline

Quite a long-winded blog post detailing how their algorithm works. Worth taking a dive into, [politics](https://observer.com/2023/03/elon-musk-twitter-follower-top-obama/) aside.
