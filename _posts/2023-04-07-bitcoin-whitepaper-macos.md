>While trying to fix my printer today, I discovered that a PDF copy of Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™s  [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) apparently shipped with every copy of macOS since Mojave in 2018.
>
>Iâ€™ve asked over a dozen Mac-using friends to confirm, and it was there for every one of them. The file is found in every version of macOS from Mojave (10.14.0) to the current version, Ventura (13.3), but isnâ€™t in High Sierra (10.13) or earlier.

>If youâ€™re on a Mac, open a Terminal and type the following command:
>
>{% highlight shell %}
>open /System/Library/Image\ Capture/Devices/VirtualScanner.app/Contents/Resources/simpledoc.pdf
>{% endhighlight %}
>
>If youâ€™re on macOS 10.14 or later, the Bitcoin PDF should immediately open in Preview.
>
>(If youâ€™re not comfortable with Terminal, open Finder and click on Macintosh HD, then open the Systemâ†’Libraryâ†’Image Captureâ†’Devices folder. Control-click on VirtualScanner.app and Show Package Contents, open the Contentsâ†’Resources folder inside, then open simpledoc.pdf.)
