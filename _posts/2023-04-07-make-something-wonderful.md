>A curated collection of Steveâ€™s speeches, interviews and correspondence, *Make Something Wonderful* offers an unparalleled window into how one of the worldâ€™s most creative entrepreneurs approached his life and work. In the pages of this book, Steve shares his perspective on his childhood, on launching and being pushed out of Apple, on his time with Pixar and NeXT, and on his ultimate return to the company that started it all.

I will be really looking forward to this when it comes out on April 11th. ðŸ‘€
