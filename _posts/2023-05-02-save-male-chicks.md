Kenny Torrella reporting for Vox:

>Even the most clueless consumer likely suspects that all is not well on the big factory farms that raise animals for food, but let me share the details of one practice with which you might be unfamiliar: Every hour, across the world, around [742,000](https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/poultry/layers/what-the-poultry-sector-is-doing-to-address-male-chick-culling) freshly hatched male chicks are born. A few hours later, they’re [tossed into a grinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZEsElYyO0Y), which kills them instantly, or gassed with carbon dioxide, which knocks them unconscious before killing them. (Rarer methods include [burning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFJPWknSEtk), [electrocution](https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010751/http://www.agri.gov.il/AGEN/Reports/Shamir001.html), [suffocation](https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/poultry/layers/animal-rights-group-films-chick-maceration-french-hatchery), and [drowning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFJPWknSEtk)).

>While the female chicks go on to lay the more than [1.2 trillion eggs](https://www.internationalegg.com/resource/global-egg-production-continues-to-grow/#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20large%20variation,eggs%20per%20person%20per%20year.) humans consume annually, [6.5 billion](https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/poultry/layers/what-the-poultry-sector-is-doing-to-address-male-chick-culling) male chicks each year are hatched, only to be quickly snuffed out. That’s because they don’t lay eggs, so they’re of no use to the egg industry, and because they don’t grow as big and fast as other chicken breeds, they’re of no use to the chicken meat industry. Even though culling costs egg producers an estimated [$500 million](https://foundationfar.org/programs/egg-tech-prize/) a year, it makes more economic sense to just kill the males on day one, rather than spend an additional dollar raising them.

Absolutely disgusting.
