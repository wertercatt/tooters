<p>Tooters.org is a general purpose Mastodon instance for English speakers operated by <a href="https://tooters.org/@victor">@victor</a>. All morally grounded individuals capable of civil discourse will feel welcome.</p>

<p><center>You can sign up for an account <a href="https://tooters.org/auth/sign_up">here</a>.</center></p>

<h2><small>Account Retention</small></h2>

<p>Should I decide I no longer wish to continue participating in the fediverse, or operating the server then I will give <b>six months advanced notice</b> to account holders so that they can migrate to a different instance.</p>

<h2><small>Moderation</small></h2>

<p>What truly defines a good instance experience is the attitude taken towards moderating fairly, and ensuring that everyone in the community can have a voice in forming the ruleset. I have been the target of online harassment, therefore I have a personally invested interest in keeping this a safe space for all.</p>

<h2><small>Bot Accounts</small></h2>

<p>Bots are allowed so long as they are ethical. For Tooters.org that means:</p>

<ul>
<li>‘This is a bot account’ is toggled on in the account’s profile settings.</li>
<li>No more than 100 toots per 24 hour period.</li>
<li>No scraping, indexing, reminder, or auto-responders.</li>
<li>No unsolicited @ mentioning of any other account.</li>
<li>No spam, or advertising.</li>
</ul>

<h2><small>NSFW Content</small></h2>

<p>Profile avatars may not be sexually explicit, or contain any imagery which would not be safe for work.</p>

<p>Sexually explicit material should have a content warning applied to mark it as sensitive so that the local timeline stays safe for work.</p>

<h2><small>Direct Messaging</small></h2>

<p>Be aware that toots sent to ‘mentioned people only’ (DMs) are not encrypted, and therefore should not be considered truly private.</p>

<h2><small>Server Rules</small></h2>

<ul>
<li><b>1. </b> No racism.</li>
<li><b>2. </b> No sexism.</li>
<li><b>3. </b> No xenophobia.</li>
<li><b>4. </b> No transphobia.</li>
<li><b>5. </b> No homophobia.</li>
<li><b>6. </b> No misgendering.</li>
<li><b>7. </b> No antisemitism, Nazism, et Al.</li>
<li><b>8. </b> No harassment, doxxing, or spamming.</li>
<li><b>9. </b> No incitement of violence, linking to sources that do, or promoting any such related ideology.</li>
<li><b>10. </b> All toots in English. Other languages could cause misunderstandings in translation, and would be difficult to accurately moderate.</li>
<li><b>11. </b> Sexually explicit material should have a content warning applied to mark it as sensitive so that the local timeline stays safe for work.</li>
<li><b>12. </b> No distribution of disinformation, or otherwise misleading information.</li>
<li><b>13. </b> No CSAM material, or media/links which violate the DMCA.</li>
<li><b>14. </b> All media toots should have alt text included because being considerate of accessibility needs is the only way to be a welcoming community.</li>
<li><b>15. </b> All multi-word hashtags should be capitalized so they are accessible to screen reader technology. For example: #streetphotography is not readable, but #StreetPhotography is.</li>

</ul>
