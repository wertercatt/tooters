<p>Tooters.org is a general purpose Mastodon instance for English speakers operated by <a href="https://tooters.org/@victor">@victor</a>. All morally grounded individuals capable of civil discourse will feel welcome.</p>

<h3>Moderation</h3>

<p>What truly defines a good experience on the fediverse is the attitude taken by your instance operator towards moderating fairly, and ensuring that everyone in the community can have a voice in forming the ruleset. Having been the target of online harassment I have a personally invested interest in keeping this a safe space for everyone.</p>

<h3>Bot Accounts</h3>

<p>Bots are allowed so long as they are ethical. For Tooters.org that means:</p>

<ul>
<li>‘This is a bot account’ is toggled on in the account’s profile settings.</li>
<li>No more than 100 toots per 24 hour period.</li>
<li>No scraping, indexing, reminder, or auto-responders.</li>
<li>No unsolicited @ mentioning of any other account.</li>
<li>No spam, or advertising.</li>
</ul>

<h3>NSFW Content</h3>

<p>Profile avatars may not be sexually explicit, or contain any imagery which would not be safe for work.</p>

<p>Sexually explicit material should have a content warning applied to mark it as sensitive so that the local timeline stays safe for work.</p>

<h3>Direct Messaging</h3>

<p>Be aware that toots sent to ‘mentioned people only’ (DMs) are not encrypted, and therefore should not be considered truly private.</p>

<h3>Account Retention</h3>

<p>Should I decide I no longer wish to continue participating in the fediverse, or operating the server then I will give <b>six months advanced notice</b> to account holders so that they can migrate to a different instance.</p>

<h3>Server Rules</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>1. </b> No racism.</li>

<li><b>9. </b> No incitement of violence, linking to sources that do, or promoting any such related ideology.</li>
<li><b>10. </b> All toots in English. Other languages could cause misunderstandings in translation, and would be difficult to accurately moderate.</li>

<li><b>15. </b> All multi-word hashtags should be capitalized so they are accessible to screen reader technology. As one example: #streetphotography is not readable, but #StreetPhotography is.</li>
</ul>
