<p>This is a general purpose Mastodon instance for English speakers. Morally grounded individuals capable of civil discourse should feel right at home.</p>

<p><center>You can submit a request for an account, and review the community rules <a href="https://tooters.org/auth/sign_up">here</a>.</center></p>

<h2>Moderation</h2>

<p>What truly defines a good experience on the fediverse is the attitude taken by your instance operator towards moderating fairly, and ensuring that everyone in the community can have a voice in forming a fair ruleset.</p>

<h2>Bot Accounts</h2>

<p>Bots are allowed so long as they are <i>ethical</i>. For Tooters.org that means:</p>

<ul>
<li>‘This is a bot account’ is toggled on in the account’s profile settings.</li>
<li>No more than 100 toots per 24 hour period.</li>
<li>No scraping, indexing, reminder, or auto-responders.</li>
<li>No unsolicited @ mentioning of any other account.</li>
<li>No spam, or advertising.</li>
</ul>

<h2>NSFW Content</h2>

<p>Profile avatars, and header images may not be sexually explicit, depict violence, or contain any such imagery.</p>

<p>Sexually explicit material must have a content warning applied to mark it as sensitive so that the local timeline stays safe for work.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>

<p>Being considerate of people who require tools such as screen readers is the only way to be a welcoming community. For that reason:</p>

<ul>
<li>All media toots should have alt text included.</li>
<li>All multi-word hashtags should be capitalized.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example: #streetphotography is not discernible to a screen reader, but #StreetPhotography is.</p>

<h2>Direct Messaging</h2>

<p>Be aware that toots sent to ‘mentioned people only’ (DMs) are not encrypted, and therefore should not be considered truly private.</p>

<h2>Account Retention</h2>

<p>In the event that Tooters.org announces we plan to discontinue operating as an instance; new account registrations will close, and current account holders will be given <b>six months advanced notice</b> so that they can be assisted in migrating their account to a different instance.</p>
