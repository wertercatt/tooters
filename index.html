Tooters.org is a general purpose instance for English speakers. Morally grounded individuals capable of civil discourse should feel right at home.

Moderation

What truly defines a good instance experience is the attitude taken towards moderating fairly, and ensuring that everyone in the community can have a voice in forming the ruleset. I have been the target of online harassment, therefore I have a personally invested interest in keeping this a safe space for all.

Bot Accounts

Bots are allowed so long as they are ethical. For Tooters.org that means:

‘This is a bot account’ is toggled on in the account’s profile settings.
No more than 100 toots per 24 hour period.
No scraping, indexing, reminder, or auto-responders.
No unsolicited @ mentioning of any other account.
No spam, or advertising.
NSFW Content

Profile avatars may not be sexually explicit, or contain any imagery which would not be safe for work.

Sexually explicit material should have a content warning applied to mark it as sensitive so that the local timeline stays safe for work.

Direct Messaging

Be aware that toots sent to ‘mentioned people only’ (DMs) are not encrypted, and therefore should not be considered truly private.
