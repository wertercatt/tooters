<h2>Bot Accounts</h2>

<p>Bots are allowed so long as they are <i>ethical</i>. For Tooters.org that means:</p>

<ul>
<li>The owner of the account is specified in the profile information.</li>
<li>‘This is a bot account’ is toggled on in the account’s profile settings.</li>
<li>No more than 100 toots per 24 hour period.</li>
<li>No scraping, indexing, reminder, or auto-responders.</li>
<li>No unsolicited @ mentioning of any other account.</li>
<li>No spam, or advertising.</li>
</ul>

<h2>NSFW Content</h2>

<p>Profile avatars, and header images may not be sexually explicit, depict violence, or contain any such imagery.</p>

<p>Sexually explicit material must have a content warning applied to mark it as sensitive so that the local timeline stays safe for work.</p>
