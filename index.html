<p><center>Tooters is a queer owned and operated server providing a safe space here for everyone under the rainbow. English, and Spanish speaking individuals capable of civil discourse should feel right at home.</center></p>

<p><center>You can create an account <a href="https://tooters.org/auth/sign_up">here</a>.</center></p>

<h2>Bot Accounts</h2>

<p>Due to recent abuse of the Tooters API bot accounts are no longer permitted on this server.</p>

<h2>NSFW Content</h2>

<p>Profile avatars, and header images may not be sexually explicit, depict violence, or contain any such imagery.</p>

<p>Sexually explicit material must have a content warning applied to mark it as sensitive so that the local timeline stays safe for work.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>

<p>Being considerate of people who require tools such as screen readers is the only way to be a welcoming community. For that reason:</p>

<ul>
<li>All media toots should have alt text included.</li>
<li>All multi-word hashtags should be capitalized.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example: #streetphotography is not discernible to a screen reader, but #StreetPhotography is.</p>

<h2>Fundraising</h2>

<p>It is common on the fediverse for people to seek financial support, or raise money for various causes. Some people do not want to see this type of content, and adding a word/hashtag to your toots which can be muted helps to achieve this.</p>

<p>Some commonly used examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://tooters.org/tags/MutualAid">#MutualAid</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tooters.org/tags/BegPost">#BegPost</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Direct Messaging</h2>

<p>Be aware that toots sent to ‘mentioned people only’ (DMs) are not encrypted, and therefore should not be considered truly private.</p>

<h2>Account Retention</h2>

<p>In the event that Tooters announces we plan to discontinue operating our server; new account registrations will close, and current account holders will be given <b>six months advanced notice</b> so that they can be assisted in migrating their account to a different provider.</p>
