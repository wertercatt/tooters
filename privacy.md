[BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SLACK AND ITS PURPOSE]

The current admins are:

[NAMES]
[HERE]
We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Discretion:

[Use this section if you’re running an invite-only slack that you don’t want non-members to know about.]

Please don’t talk about [SLACKNAME] in public. This is a private, invitation-only slack. Please don’t discuss it in public, or with people who aren’t members. It can cause awkwardness and hurt feelings if people start asking what it is and how to get invited. Further, harassers and abusers may be surveilling some members of this slack. Keeping the existence of this slack private makes it more difficult for bad actors to triangulate their targets’ social footprints.

If you wish to nominate someone for membership, please contact the admins (before you speak to the person you wish to invite).

Confidentiality:

[Use this section if you expect your members to respect the confidentiality of this space. Please be mindful that because slacks are closed networks, they can foster a false sense of security that leads people to share things that really should not be public. If you have members who you suspect might leak conversations and files hosted on your slack, either kick them out or use the ‘Logs and Records’ section below instead of this one.]

Please keep what’s said in [SLACKNAME] confidential. Don’t repeat or quote things said here without the affirmative consent of the speaker(s). When quoting (with consent), please be careful not to reveal the existence of [SLACKNAME]. Rather, you can refer to the quote as something that was said “in chat” or while you were talking to the quoted member.

Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public. While we expect members to honor the confidentiality of this space, we cannot guarantee that they will do so—nor can we guarantee that every member’s login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.

Logs and Records:

[Use this section in place of ‘confidentiality’ (above) if you want to signal more strongly to members that they shouldn’t trust the privacy of your slack. Admins should be on the lookout for conversations that require a greater level of security than you can provide, and warn members that their discussion should be moved to a more secure platform.]

Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public. We cannot prevent people from screencapping or otherwise logging this slack. We also can’t guarantee that every member’s login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Files uploaded here can be downloaded by anyone with a login. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.

Message Retention:

[FOR FREE SLACKS]: Because this is a free slack account, we have restricted scrollback, but Slack—the company—retains complete logs of all channels and direct messages back to the creation of [SLACKNAME]. Slack is a U.S. company and therefore subject to subpoenas from U.S. courts. Our logs may be subject to subpoena and could become public as part of legal proceedings.

[FOR PAID SLACKS WITH MESSAGE RETENTION POLICIES]:

[SLACKNAME] uses Slack’s message retention features to delete old messages and uploaded files. Our retention policies are as follows:

Harassment:

Harassment includes:

Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names
Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate
Simulated physical contact (e.g. textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.
Threats of violence
Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
Deliberate intimidation
Sustained disruption of discussion
Unwelcome sexual attention
Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
Publication of non-harassing private communication
Reporting

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the admins. They’ll respond as promptly as they can.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from this slack and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we’ve received complaints.
