Tooters.org is a fediverse instance for English speakers. Morally grounded individuals capable of civil discourse will feel right at home. You can review the community rules, and request an account [here](https://tooters.org/).

## <small>Bot Accounts</small>

Bots are allowed so long as they are *ethical*. For Tooters.org that means:

- The owner of the account is specified in the profile information.
- ‘This is a bot account’ is toggled on in the account’s profile settings.
- No more than 100 toots per 24 hour period.
- No scraping, indexing, reminder, or auto-responders.
- No unsolicited @ mentioning of any other account.
- No spam, or advertising.

## <small>NSFW Content</small>

Profile avatars, and header images may not be sexually explicit, depict violence, or contain any such imagery.

Sexually explicit material must have a content warning applied to mark it as sensitive so that the local timeline stays safe for work.

## <small>Accessibility</small>

Being considerate of people who require tools such as screen readers is the only way to be a welcoming community. For that reason:

- All media toots should have alt text included.
- All multi-word hashtags should be capitalized.

For example: #streetphotography is not discernible to a screen reader, but #StreetPhotography is.

## <small>Direct Messaging</small>

Be aware that toots sent to ‘mentioned people only’ (DMs) are not encrypted, and therefore should not be considered truly private.

## <small>Account Retention</small>

In the event that Tooters.org announces we plan to discontinue operating as an instance; new account registrations will close, and current account holders will be given **six months advanced notice** so that they can be assisted in migrating their account to a different instance.

## <small>Support</small>

You can reach out to us by mentioning [@tooters](https://tooters.org/@tooters) or by sending an email to [hello@tooters.org](mailto:hello@tooters.org).
