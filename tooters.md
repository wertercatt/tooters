## <small>Server Status</small>

Tooters.org is a general purpose Mastodon instance for English speakers. Morally grounded individuals capable of civil discourse should feel right at home.

You can submit a request for an account, and review the community rules [here](https://tooters.org/auth/sign_up).

## <small>Moderation</small>

What truly defines a good experience on the fediverse is the attitude taken by your instance operator towards moderating fairly, and ensuring that everyone in the community can have a voice in forming a fair ruleset.

## <small>Bot Accounts</small>

Bots are allowed so long as they are *ethical*. For Tooters.org that means:

- ‘This is a bot account’ is toggled on in the account’s profile settings.
- No more than 100 toots per 24 hour period.
- No scraping, indexing, reminder, or auto-responders.
- No unsolicited @ mentioning of any other account.
- No spam, or advertising.
  
## <small>NSFW Content</small>

Profile avatars, and header images may not be sexually explicit, depict violence, or contain any such imagery.
Sexually explicit material must have a content warning applied to mark it as sensitive so that the local timeline stays safe for work.

## <small>Accessibility</small>

Being considerate of people who require tools such as screen readers is the only way to be a welcoming community. For that reason:

- All media toots should have alt text included.
- All multi-word hashtags should be capitalized.
 
For example: #streetphotography is not discernible to a screen reader, but #StreetPhotography is.

## <small>Direct Messaging</small>

Be aware that toots sent to ‘mentioned people only’ (DMs) are not encrypted, and therefore should not be considered truly private.

## <small>Account Retention</small>

In the event that Tooters.org announces discontinuing operating as an instance; new account registrations will close, and current account holders will be given **six months advanced notice** so that they can be assisted in migrating their account to a different instance.

## <small>Support</small>

You can reach out by mentioning [@tooters](https://tooters.org/@tooters)  or by sending an email to [hello@tooters.org](mailto:hello@tooters.org).

## <small>Service Status</small>
